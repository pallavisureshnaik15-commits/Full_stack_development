# HTML

- Introduction to HTML
- Different Tags


# What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup langugage for creating web page
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML page and which are represented by Tags
So browser do not display the html tags but use them to render the content of the page

Let see with example
<html>
<HTML>

html is not case sensitive which means we are free to use any case eithr 
uppercase or lowercase or title case
but try to stick any prefered case


<!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
<HTML> element is the root element of any html page
<head> element contains meta information about the document
<title> element specifies a title for the document which you can see on browser tab
<body> element contains the visible page content of the document
<h1> element define a large heading or most important content of the document
<p> element define a paragraph


# The <!DOCTYPE> declaration
> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represent the document type and hlp the browser to display
web page correctly
> It must only appear once at the top page (before html tag)
> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive
> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML 5 is

<!DOCTYPE html>

however there are mny other declaration type which we can use in html document
depending upon what version of html is beign used


# HTML Version
since the early days of the web there have been many version of HTML

Html 1.0
html 2.0
html 3.2
html 4
html 5 --- 2014

<tag>   --- opening tags
</tag>  --- closing tags

there is one other type of tag know as self closing or empty tags

<tag /> 
example: <img />  <br />  <hr />

Attributes
are use to provide some additional information with the elements
different attributes are used with different html tags
for example:
img - src attribute which provide information of the image source
a - href - hyper reference provide the url of the destination



# HTML Heading
HTML heading are define with <h1> to <h6> tag
<h1> define the most important heading
<h6> define the least important heading
<h1>This is heading</h1>
<h2>This is heading</h2>
<h3>This is heading</h3>
<h4>This is heading</h4>
<h5>This is heading</h5>
<h6>This is heading</h6>

> it automatically format your text into bold and bigger font which is also usefull
to understand visually
> For SEO purpose also heading tag plays an important role becaise all the web crawler
read these tags


# HTML Paragraph
<p>
HTML paragraph are define with <p> tag
It we want to split our content in paragraph we can use <p> tag
It automatically add a line break and space

Example:
<p>This is my parapraph</p>
<p>This is my other parapraph</p>

not like any word document you can manage intent buy presing space or tab key
as the browser  will remove any extra space and extra line when page is displayed

# HTML Line Break
<br> - break rule
When we use <br> element anything folling will start from next line
THis tag is an example of any empty element where we do not need opeining and closing tags
as there is  nothing to go in between them

the <br /> tag has a space betwen the character br and forward slash 
If we omit the space, older browser will have trouble rendering the line break
while if we miss / and use just <br> it is not a valid in xhtml


# HTML Horizontal Line
<hr /> - Horizontal Rule
> Horizontal line are use to visually break up section of a document
> The <hr> tag to create a line from current position in the document 
to the right margin and break the line accordingly
> Again <hr /> tag is an example of empty or self closing element where we 
do not need opeining and closing as there is nothing to go in between


# <center>
Centering contant
we can use <center> tag to put content in the center of the page


# <pre>
Preserve formating
> some time we want that our text to follow the exact format of how it is written
in the HTML document in that case we can use pre formatterd tag <pre>

exmaple:
function testFunction(parameter){
    alert(parameter)
}

> any text betwen the opening <pre> tag and closing will preserve the formatting
of the source document


# HTML Links
HTML link are define with <a> tag or anchor tag which basically use for
navigation purpose so we can refer to any page inside our root folder or any
other external or internal URL

> If we want to open in new tab we can use another attribite in anchor tag
target="blank"

> we can also create a single page web app using <a> tag where we can scroll up and 
down based on user selection in that we have to use

<a href="#section1">Section 1</a>

<div id="section1">
</div>

example:
<a href="">Click</a>


# HTML Images
HTML images are define with <img> tag
again img tag is also an self closing or empty tag
we can use couple attribute along with img tag to define image source

src - source or source of the image 
title - text which will appear on tooltip
alt - alternative text which will appear if for some reason there 
      is some error and image not found

example:
<img src="" title="" alt=""/>
alt is important for image optimization in SEO as we can take this as an 
opportunity to use alt tag to add our seach keyword

image format
jpg / jpeg
gif
png

png vs jpg
png fomrat we use for transparent background


# HTML List
HTML list are define with <ul> or <ol> tags
<ul>  - unordered list / bullet list
<ol> - ordered list / numbered list

followed by <li> tag which is know as list item

unordered list
. item 1
. item 2
. item 3

order list
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3


in unordered list we can chnage or choose list item marker
the css list-style property is used to define the style of the list item marker

disc - default

# HTML Formatting tag 
HTML provides different tag for framtting the content

<b>
<i>
<strong>
<em>
<mark>
<small>
<del>


# HTML Table
HTML table to create a table on web page to display some data
this is one of the most used html element in the application
To create a table we have to use series of tags
<table> - parent block
<tr> - table row
<th> - table heading
<td> - table data / table cell

border attribute if you want to add default border for the table

colspan="2" - merge column where 2 is a number of column you want to merge
rowspan="2" - merge row where 2 is a number of row you want to merge


# HTML Forms
Forms are the essential part of any application as form can use to take the
input from the user
Forms are the one which are use by the user to interact with your application

In a form we can create different type element to accept values

textbox
dropdrowList
checkbox
radioButton
buttons
textarea

<input> which can be use to create textbox, radio, checkbox, button
<select> which can use to create dropdown

<input>
textbox - text
textbox - password
radio
checkbox
submit button

<input type="text" />
placeholder - kind of watermark which will disappear when enter a value
readonly - make textbox uneditable
type - define what kind of textbox you want to create text/password
name - to provide a name which we will use to acess value
id - to provide unique id for textbox

> dropdown
To create a drop down we will use 
<select>
<option>
drop down list is use to provide multiple options to the user where user can 
make a single selection


> CheckBox vs RadioButton

radio - single selection (eg: gender)
checkbox - multiple selection (eg: interest)

<input type="radio" value=""/>
<input type="checkbox" />

when ever we create a radiobutton we also have to provide a corresponding value

> buttons
Button are important to handle events
we can create different type of button
we can also have button outside forms for some other purpose

type of button
- button
- submit
- reset
